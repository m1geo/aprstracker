\r\n conversion to CR/LF works, but if for some reason the GPS expects 
that the order is reversed (i.e. \n\r) then the conversion fails.

Currently only a SSID in the range 0-9 can be entered. 
This should be extended to 0-15.
For the time being a work-around is possible by entering
    -:	for SSID -10
    -;	for SSID -11
    -<	for SSID -12
    -=	for SSID -13
    ->	for SSID -14
    -?	for SSID -15

# aprstracker
An update on aprstracker-0.12 project by PE1RXQ and PE1ICQ.

On 15 September 2013, I (@m1geo) spoke with Arno (PE1ICQ) and received the code provided in the initial check in (aprstracker-0.12). Tracker version 0.11 didn't support 9600 baud GPS receivers (despite the v0.11 docs daying it does). Version 0.12 does support 9600 baud NEMA GPS receivers, but contains bugs with the altitude calculation.
